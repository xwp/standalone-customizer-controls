Use Customizer controls in contexts outside of the Customizer itself.

This is a demonstration of how to use Customizer settings and controls outside the context of the Customizer app. The goal of this demo is to show how Customizer controls can be used in Shortcode UI (Shortcake) forms and also provide an example for how Customizer controls can be embedded on the frontend.

Please install and active the Customize Posts plugin to use all of the examples.

To access the examples, please go to the admin and access Appearance > Standalone Customizer Controls Demo.
